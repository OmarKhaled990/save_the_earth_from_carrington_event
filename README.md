# save_the_earth_from_carrington_event
A Carrington Event is the biggest solar storm happened and Affected Our Plant Earth in 1859 that all the Telegraphs was burned at that time, So, We saw that if we can predict the possible solar storm that will come to Earth we can save our technologies and save people from Cancer and other diseases caused by the solar storms, Since we are in the era of AI, our solution uses AI Algorithm to predict the next potential Carrington-like event and provides info about the previous solar events, Our Solution has an easy UX that will ease navigating between the pages of our website

# Dataset: 
We used Wind's ions Parameters Dataset given by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), The files was .CDF format so we had to convert it to .CSV format first, We used CDFTOOLSDRIVER to help us in reading and understanding the Data, After converting multiple .CDF files to .CSV format we had to merge them in one Excel Sheet, Here comes the Data preprocessing Phase.

# Machine Learning:
We used XGBOOST Algorithm for our forecasting problem, It is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library. It provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading machine learning library for regression, classification, and ranking problems, We trained the model on multiple Variables to see which variable provides best accuracy.
